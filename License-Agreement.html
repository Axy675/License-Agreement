    <p>Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement ("Standard EULA") or a custom end user license agreement between you and the Application Provider ("Custom EULA"), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the "Licensed Application." The Application Provider or Apple as applicable ("Licensor") reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.</p>

    <h2>Scope of License</h2>
    <p>Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).</p>
    
    <h2>Consent to Use of Data</h2>
    <p>You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p>
    
    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.</p>
    
    <h2>External Services</h2>
    <p>The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services.</p>
    
    <h2>No Warranty</h2>
    <p>You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Licensed Application is at your sole risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensed Application and any services performed or provided by the Licensed Application are provided "as is" and "as available," with all faults and without warranty of any kind. Licensor hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with respect to the Licensed Application and any services, either express, implied, or statutory.</p>
    
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall Licensor be liable for personal injury or any incidental, special, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or any other commercial damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Licensed Application, however caused, regardless of the theory of liability.</p>
    
    <h2>Export Compliance</h2>
    <p>You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained.</p>
    
    <h2>U.S. Government Rights</h2>
    <p>The Licensed Application and related documentation are "Commercial Items" as defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation."</p>
    
    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this Agreement and the relationship between you and Apple shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You and Apple agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, to resolve any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement.</p>
    <p>If you are a citizen of any European Union country or Switzerland, Norway, or Iceland, the governing law and forum shall be the laws and courts of your usual place of residence. Specifically excluded from application to this Agreement is that law known as the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.</p>
